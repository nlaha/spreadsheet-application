## StyleCop Changes

Disabled "fields should not begin with underscore"
- I prefer naming my private fields starting with "_" as it makes assigning them in constructors easier (I can have the same name without an underscore for the parameters)

Disabled "documentation should end with a period"
- This is just not necessary, it doesn't make the code cleaner and it's one more thing that I have to remember to do
